I have been learning web development for over a year through online resources such as FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project and CodeCademy. I spent a lot of time practicing by building different projects. I was also able to work on real projects with a team during my internship in an agency. This experience confirmed that I wanted to stay in web development and I'm now looking for the next step. My current goal is to level up my skill set as I deliver business value. I am a friendly, hard-working and passionate person. I attach grand importance to details and responsive design.",
